                    <p> The Lighthouse is a 2019 film directed and produced by Robert Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Max Eggers. It was an international co-production of the United States and Canada, with the film being shot in black-and-white with a nearly square 1.19:1 aspect ratio. Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star as two lighthouse keepers who begin to descend into madness when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.
